**Malware**
Malware, short for "malicious software," is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. Cybercriminals use malware to steal, encrypt, or delete sensitive data, hijack or monitor users' computer activity, or perform other harmful actions. Common types of malware include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomeware, spyware, etc.
**Malware Analysis**
Malware analysis is the process of studying and understanding the behavior, origins, and potential impact of malware. The goal of malware analysis is to determine how a particular piece of malware works, how it spreads, and what it does once it infects a system. 
**Static malware Analysis**
Examining the malware's code without executing it. This can include looking at the file's structure, strings, and binary code to identify potential indicators of compromise and comparing the malware's code against a database of known malware signatures to identify it or determine if it's a variant of existing malware.
