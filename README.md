# Malware Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains resources and tools for analyzing malware, including static and dynamic analysis techniques. Malware, short for "malicious software," refers to any software designed to cause harm to computers, servers, networks, or users. Cybercriminals use malware to steal, encrypt, or delete sensitive data, hijack user activity, or perform other harmful actions.

Common types of malware include:

- **Viruses**
- **Worms**
- **Trojans**
- **Ransomware**
- **Spyware**

## Malware Analysis Techniques

### 1. Static Malware Analysis

Static analysis involves examining the malware's code without executing it. The primary goals of static analysis include:

- **File Structure Examination**: Analyze the file structure to understand the organization of the malware's code.
- **String Analysis**: Extract and review strings within the binary to identify potential indicators of compromise (IoCs).
- **Signature Matching**: Compare the malware's code against a database of known malware signatures to identify it or determine if it is a variant of existing malware.
- **Disassembly**: Disassemble the binary code to study the instructions that the malware executes.

### 2. Dynamic Malware Analysis 

- **Behavior Observation**: Monitor the malware's behavior during execution, including any changes it makes to the file system, registry, or memory.
- **Network Activity Monitoring**: Track the network traffic generated by the malware to identify any attempts to communicate with command and control (C2) servers, download additional payloads, or exfiltrate data.
- **Process and Service Interaction**: Observe the creation of new processes or services, and analyze how the malware interacts with other processes or system components.
- **Evasion Techniques Detection**: Identify any anti-analysis techniques employed by the malware, such as sandbox detection, anti-debugging methods, or timing delays designed to hinder analysis.
