# Static Malware Analysis

Static analysis involves examining the malware's code without executing it. The primary goals of static analysis include:

- **File Structure Examination:** Analyze the file structure to understand the organization of the malware's code.

- **String Analysis:** Extract and review strings within the binary to identify potential indicators of compromise (IoCs).

- **Signature Matching:** Compare the malware's code against a database of known malware signatures to identify it or determine if it is a variant of existing malware.

- **Disassembly:** Disassemble the binary code to study the instructions that the malware executes.

## Flie Structure Examination

Initially we have two sample files named as **malware-sample-2.zip** and **XMoon.bin.zip**.

When we unzip the XMoon.bin.zip file we get a .bin file. 
Right now we don't know the file type so in this case we are going to use an app known as **HxD**.
Simply drag and drop the .bin file into HxD app we will get an cryptic interface.
Now we are going to look for **MZ, 4D, 5A** and **This program cannot be run in DOS mode** in the code

Presence of this keywords in a code simply means that this is a executable file (.exe).
It is important to look for such keywords because many times the malware is packed in a differet file format.

## String Analysis

String analysis is the process of analysing of specific strings in a file without actually executing the file.
For string analysis we are going to use **cmder**. Upload the file on cmder and run the command **strings -n 8** this 
command basically returns the all the strings in the file that are greater than 8 words.

Now we have small area to search for any irrelevent strings in the program, here we found a string that says **This program cannot be run in DOS mode** as we discussed earlier this keyword implies that the given file is a exe file.
