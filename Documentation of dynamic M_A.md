# Dynamic Malware Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on conducting **dynamic malware analysis** to examine the behavior of malicious software in a controlled environment. The analysis includes the observation of **process activity**, **network activity**, **registry activity**, and **persistence mechanisms** used by malware to maintain a foothold on a compromised system.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze **Process Activity**: Track process creation, resource usage, and memory manipulation.
- Monitor **Network Activity**: Observe network communication initiated by the malware.
- Investigate **Registry Activity**: Identify registry modifications performed by the malware.
- Examine **Persistence Mechanisms**: Uncover techniques malware uses to maintain persistence.

## Analysis Breakdown

### 1. Process Activity
- Monitored process creation, termination, and inter-process communications.
- Captured resource usage patterns and suspicious behaviors like memory injections.
- Tools used:  Process Monitor

### 2. Network Activity
- Identified outbound network traffic and DNS requests initiated by the malware.
- Analyzed communication with Command and Control (C2) servers.
- Tools used: Wireshark

### 3. Registry Activity
- Tracked registry key creation, modification, and deletion.
- Focused on keys commonly targeted by malware (e.g., run keys for persistence).
- Tools used: Regshot, Process Monitor

### 4. Persistence Mechanisms
- Detected techniques used by the malware to achieve persistence across reboots.
- Examined auto-start entries and scheduled tasks.
- Tools used: Task Scheduler

## Environment Setup

- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Tools**: Process Monitor, Wireshark, Regshot, Task Scheduler
- **VM**: Analysis was conducted in an isolated virtual machine for safety (Virtual box).
